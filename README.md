# About
The No Means No Festival is a 3 day event that allows survivors and allies to come together to spread awareness about sexual violence. Our mission is to allows others to feel comfortable to share their stories in a safe space while also being able to meet others that have gone through similar situations. This shows that we are not alone in this, and we can educate others on how to prevent the likelines of this happening to someone else. 

We want to call attention to those that have gone through sexual harassment, rape, sexual abuse and sexual violence, for there are those that didn't have anyone believe them, didn't receive justice and are afraid to come forward due to potential threat/retaliation. 

For this festival, the Our Wave Organization will be partnering up with us to bring the message to our audience. They are known to bring a sense of community for survivors and also to educate others that would love to know more of what they can do to spread awareness about these things happening. All purchases that goes towards tickets and merchandize will all go towards this organization as donations to help fund education for this topic. 

# Overview
This festival will address sexual violence that relate to the #MeToo movement that both women and men face. 

There will be 3 days of events and activities planned to educate others and also give everyone a chance to speak up about story while being anonymous. 

- Day 1: Lantern Festival: Survivors and allies get a compostable paper lantern, and get a chance to write on the lantern before releasing it into the sky. This allows others to write something personal and private to them, releasing it into the sky. This is to symbolize having something that they've been wanting to let go of for a really long time, giving participants the ability to release and feel relief. 

- Day 2: Storytelling Day: Those that have a story have a chance to come up on stage sharing their experience behind a screen, protecting their identity. Participants that wish to not share on stage can write on a post it note, sharing their story on the wall and others can write a response of wisdom and kindess to each note. Survivors and allies have the chance to read others' stories even when not spoken outloud. 

- Day 3: No Means No March: Morning will consist of walking together as a group with shirts and signs, sharing the issues of sexual violence. This helps spread awareness and brings a sense of community to others. Walking and marching together hand in hand brings a stronger message.
