    <p>There are so many people that have experienced sexual harassment and either experienced one of the following: 
    no one believed them, they did not receive justice for what has happened to them, or are afraid to come forward 
    due to potential threat/retaliation. Spreading awareness about this topic can help others find their voice and 
    educate people on why this is not okay. </p>
    <br>
    <p>This festival allows others to come and share their story with others. It's a great way to educate those that 
        want to learn about these experiences and how they can help to prevent and spread awareness. Come join us starting
        December 8th, 2023.
