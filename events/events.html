        <h1>DECEMBER 8|LANTERN FESTIVAL</h1>
        <p>Every participant will be provided a lantern for the lantern festival. Everyone will have 
            the chance to write on the lantern, releasing what they need to say or let off their chest.
            Participants will get to release the lanterns into the nightsky.</p><br>

        <h1>DECEMBER 9|STORYTELLING DAY</h1>
        <p>Sometimes, telling your story is helpful for others to be educated on the topic and also to be able
            to express yourself. Especially when it's terrifying to come forward. The whole event will be anonymous
            and no one will know your name or see how you look like. This is a way for others to come forward with their 
            experiences and to share. There will be other opportunities as well for others that don't want to share outloud, but 
            still have a lot to say. This day will be dedicated for everyone to speak up and spread kindness. </p><br>

        <h1>DECEMBER 10|#MeToo MARCH</h1>
        <p>Early in the morning, we will all walk together and unite as one. We will march through the streets in downtown San Francisco
            on Market St to show how much this affects sexual violence survivors. WE will show how strong we are as people, while also educating
            others of this movement. Meet on SF Market St in front of IKEA to show your support for both men and women that have gone through these experiences 
            and make yourself feel heard. The Our Wave Organization will be partnering up with us for the march and walk together with everyone. </p><br>
